Hereby the release of DeVIDE version 8.2 is announced.  This is the first open source release of the software.

DeVIDE, or the Delft Visualization and Image processing Development Environment, is a Python-based dataflow application builder that enables the rapid prototyping of medical visualization and image processing applications via visual programming. In other words, by visually connecting functional blocks (think Yahoo pipes), you can create cool visualizations.  DeVIDE is primarily used in medical visualization research and education.

The central information point is the [main DeVIDE homepage](http://visualisation.tudelft.nl/Projects/DeVIDE), with links to more documentation, binary and source downloads, the mailing list and a news blog.

For a summary of the changes in the new DeVIDE version 8.2, see the [ChangeLog-Summary](http://code.google.com/p/devide/source/browse/branches/v8-2/devide/docs/ChangeLog-Summary.txt).

Since the previous closed source release in September 2007, the software has been greatly improved and restructured.  Nonetheless, there is still much to do.  If you come across any bugs, or have any suggestions for improvements, please enter them in the [Issue Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/devide/issues/list).
