Hereby the release of DeVIDE version 8.5 is announced.

DeVIDE, or the Delft Visualization and Image processing Development Environment, is a Python-based dataflow application builder that enables the rapid prototyping of medical visualization and image processing applications via visual programming. In other words, by visually connecting functional blocks (think Yahoo pipes), you can create cool visualizations.  DeVIDE is primarily used in medical visualization research and education.

The central information point is the [main DeVIDE homepage](http://visualisation.tudelft.nl/Projects/DeVIDE), with links to more documentation, binary and source downloads, the mailing list and a news blog.

For a summary of the changes in the new DeVIDE version 8.5, see the [ChangeLog-Summary](http://code.google.com/p/devide/source/browse/branches/v8-5/devide/docs/ChangeLog-Summary.txt).

Each release of DeVIDE contains some major new cool functionality, or at least that's the idea.  8.5 is all about the brand-new GDCM-based DICOM support, and especially the DICOMBrowser module.  See [this screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLfu6JXkWP4) for a demo.
