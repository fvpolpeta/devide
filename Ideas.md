# More integrated UI #

All module views should be floatable dockable windows in the AUI interface. This would make it possible to build up one's one specific view. It should be possible to save a complete workspace, including the network and the specific view configuration.

Can AUI panels be tabbed, and can floatable dockable windows be added as tabs to an existing docked window? This would be a requirement.
