DeVIDE, or the Delft Visualization and Image processing Development Environment, is a Python-based dataflow application builder that enables the rapid prototyping of medical visualization and image processing applications via visual programming.  In other words, by visually connecting functional blocks (think Yahoo pipes), you can create cool visualizations.

DeVIDE is distributed as part of the DRE, or DeVIDE Runtime Environment.  The DRE is in fact a Python distribution that includes cmake, swig, Python, numpy, matplotlib, wxPython, gdcm, VTK, ITK and DeVIDE itself.  With the DRE, you can easily develop your own Python applications and also C++ extension modules, as the C++ SDK is included.  See the [DRE help page](HelpDRE.md) for more details.
